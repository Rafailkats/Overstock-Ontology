# Overstock-Ontology
In the context of a thesis, an ontology of semantic knowledge was created for household objects, called Overstock. The first step in the implementation is the creation of a complete and sufficient dataset. The data for the items was retrieved from the overstock online store Overstock.com, using the method of scrapping.
